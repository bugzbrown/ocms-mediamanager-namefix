# OctoberCMS Media Manager File Name Fix

One issue that has been bugging me for some time is that there is no sanitazation of filenames in OctoberCMS' Media Manager.

This simple plugin is based off a post by [Murphy.Adrian28211](https://octobercms.com/forum/user/murphyadrian28211) - Since it is a rather obscure post and took me some time to find it, I figured I'd make a plugin so that anybody can benefit from this simple, yet effective workaround.

Simply install the plugin and it will work it's magic. It will "slug" any and every file you upload to media manager.
